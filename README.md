# The experiences of a software developer on the fritz.
Hey, I'm Conner, and I'm a Software Developer turned Engineering Leader based in Toronto.
I fell in love with coding as a child, teaching myself how to use the power of code to solve problems and bring my ideas to reality. It's been an important part of my life ever since.
### I'm here to share my passion for coding and problem-solving and encourage people to think more empathetically about technology and organizations.
